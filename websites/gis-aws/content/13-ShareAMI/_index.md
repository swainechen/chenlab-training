In many cases it is more convenient to provide not just the data files but also the whole environment to process or reproduce results. This will enable collaborators to run their own analyses without re-building your setup or environment.

**b.	[Share an EBS snapshot with a specific AWS account.](http://slchen-lab-training.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/13-shareami/03-sharesnapshot.html)**
